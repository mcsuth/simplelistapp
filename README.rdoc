# ABOUT

This is a simple RoR "To Do" app. The "Devise" gem was used to implement the sign-in/sign-up portion, javaScript and jQuery were used to make the application unobtrusive and asynchronous, and a tutorial from "Tympanus" was used to create the modal. I wasn't quite sure how to use Devise with the modal tutorial.
